# Netflix-Data-Analytics

# Introduction
This project aims to analyze Netflix data using various data analytics techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including their titles, directors, cast members, genres, release year, and more.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files:

netflix_titles.csv: This file contains the raw data used for analysis. It is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and can be opened in spreadsheet software or loaded into a programming environment for analysis.

netflix_data_analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code and analysis performed on the Netflix dataset. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to load and preprocess the data, perform various analyses, and visualize the results.

requirements.txt: This file lists the Python libraries and their versions required to run the code in the notebook. You can install these dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage
The netflix_data_analysis.ipynb notebook provides a comprehensive guide on how to analyze the Netflix dataset. Each code cell is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose and functionality. You can execute the cells one by one to see the results.

The notebook covers various aspects of data analysis, including:

Loading and inspecting the dataset
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis
Visualizations of key insights
Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
Feel free to modify the code or add your own analyses based on your specific requirements.
